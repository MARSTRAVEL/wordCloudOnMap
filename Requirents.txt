Requirements:
1. First, you should do a post HTTP request to:
http://cs.uef.fi/o-mopsi/controller/OMopsiGameController.php
with parameters {request_type: "get_games", userId: -1}
You will get a result that contains 'allGames' JSON array. In that array, the important information for you is:
- desc (the game name - make a dropdown list to select a game by name)
- gameId (you will need it in second step)
- latitude and longitude are the coordinates. Use those to decide where your overlay will be placed.
You can also ignore these and do another variant (explained in second step below)
- you can also use the thumbnail to display on map, but it is optional, I think.

2. Once you select a game, need to get information about it using a port request to:
http://cs.uef.fi/o-mopsi/controller/OMopsiGameController.php with
parameters {request_type: "get_goals", gameId: 1918} (game ID from step 1) As a result,
you will get an array of 'goals'. Each goal has a 'goalName' which you need to use for the word cloud.

I recommend splitting the goalName string by space or punctuation marks (.,-_?!)
and then combining all the words from all the goals into one bag.
Then count frequencies of each word to decide the weight for your 'inputWords' array.
